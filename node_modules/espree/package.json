Espree's first version is therefore v1.2.2 and is 100% compatible with Esprima v1.2.2 as a drop-in replacement. The version number will be incremented based on [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) as features and bug fixes are added.\n\nThe immediate plans are:\n\n1. Move away from giant files and move towards small, modular files that are easier to manage.\n1. Move towards CommonJS for all files and use browserify to create browser bundles.\n1. Support ECMAScript version filtering, allowing users to specify which version the parser should work in (similar to Acorn's `ecmaVersion` property).\n1. Add tests to track comment attachment.\n1. Add well-thought-out features that are useful for tools developers.\n1. Add full support for ECMAScript 6.\n1. Add optional parsing of JSX.\n\n## Esprima Compatibility Going Forward\n\nThe primary goal is to produce the exact same AST structure as Esprima and Acorn, and that takes precedence over anything else. (The AST structure being the SpiderMonkey Parser API with JSX extensions.) Separate from that, Espree may deviate from what Esprima outputs in terms of where and how comments are attached, as well as what additional information is available on AST nodes. That is to say, Espree may add more things to the AST nodes than Esprima does but the overall AST structure produced will be the same.\n\nEspree may also deviate from Esprima in the interface it exposes.\n\n## Frequent and Incremental Releases\n\nEspree will not do giant releases. Releases will happen periodically as changes are made and incremental releases will be made towards larger goals. For instance, we will not have one big release for ECMAScript 6 support. Instead, we will implement ECMAScript 6, piece-by-piece, hiding those pieces behind an `ecmaFeatures` property that allows you to opt-in to use those features.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIssues and pull requests will be triaged and responded to as quickly as possible. We operate under the [ESLint Contributor Guidelines](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing.html), so please be sure to read them before contributing. If you're not sure where to dig in, check out the [issues](https://github.com/eslint/espree/issues).\n\nEspree is licensed under a permissive BSD 3-clause license.\n\n## Build Commands\n\n* `npm test` - run all linting and tests\n* `npm run lint` - run all linting\n* `npm run browserify` - creates a version of Espree that is usable in a browser\n\n## Known Incompatibilities\n\nIn an effort to help those wanting to transition from other parsers to Espree, the following is a list of noteworthy incompatibilities with other parsers. These are known differences that we do not intend to change.\n\n### Esprima 1.2.2\n\n* None.\n\n### Esprima/Harmony Branch\n\n* Esprima/Harmony uses a different comment attachment algorithm that results in some comments being added in different places than Espree. The algorithm Espree uses is the same one used in Esprima 1.2.2.\n* Template tokens have a `head` property in addition to `tail`. Esprima has only `tail`.\n\n### Esprima-FB\n\n* All Esprima/Harmony incompatibilities.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Why are you forking Esprima?\n\n[ESLint](http://eslint.org) has been relying on Esprima as its parser from the beginning. While that was fine when the JavaScript language was evolving slowly, the pace of development has increased dramatically and Esprima has fallen behind. ESLint, like many other tools reliant on Esprima, has been stuck in using new JavaScript language features until Esprima updates, and that has caused our users frustration.\n\nWe decided the only way for us to move forward was to create our own parser, bringing us inline with JSHint and JSLint, and allowing us to keep implementing new features as we need them. We chose to fork Esprima instead of starting from scratch in order to move as quickly as possible with a compatible API.\n\n### Have you tried working with Esprima?\n\nYes. Since the start of ESLint, we've regularly filed bugs and feature requests with Esprima. Unfortunately, we've been unable to make much progress towards getting our needs addressed.\n\n### Why don't you just use Facebook's Esprima fork?\n\n`esprima-fb` is Facebook's Esprima fork that features JSX and Flow type annotations. We tried working with `esprima-fb` in our evaluation of how to support ECMAScript 6 and JSX in ESLint. Unfortunately, we were hampered by bugs that were part of Esprima (not necessarily Facebook's code). Since `esprima-fb` tracks the Esprima Harmony branch, that means we still were unable to get fixes or features we needed in a timely manner.\n\n### Why don't you just use Acorn?\n\nAcorn is a great JavaScript parser that produces an AST that is compatible with Esprima. Unfortunately, ESLint relies on more than just the AST to do its job. It relies on Esprima's tokens and comment attachment features to get a complete picture of the source code. We investigated switching to Acorn, but the inconsistencies between Esprima and Acorn created too much work for a project like ESLint.\n\nWe expect there are other tools like ESLint that rely on more than just the AST produced by Esprima, and so a drop-in replacement will help those projects as well as ESLint.\n\n### What ECMAScript 6 features do you support?\n\nPlease see the [tracking issue](https://github.com/eslint/espree/issues/10) for the most up-to-date information.\n\n### Why use Espree instead of Esprima?\n\n* Faster turnaround time on bug fixes\n* More frequent releases\n* Better communication and responsiveness to issues\n* Ongoing development\n\n### Why use Espree instead of Esprima-FB?\n\n* Opt-in to just the ECMAScript 6 features you want\n* JSX support is off by default, so you're not forced to use it to use ECMAScript 6\n* Stricter ECMAScript 6 support\n",
