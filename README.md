Installation and Usage
----------------------

You can run JSDoc on either Node.js or Mozilla Rhino.

### Node.js

Native support for Node.js is available in JSDoc 3.3.0 and later. JSDoc
supports Node.js 0.10 and later.

#### Installing JSDoc for Node.js

You can install JSDoc in your project's `node_modules` folder, or you can
install it globally.

To install the latest version available on NPM:

    npm install jsdoc

To install the latest development version:

    npm install jsdoc3/jsdoc

#### Running JSDoc with Node.js

If you installed JSDoc locally, the JSDoc command-line tool is available in
`./node_modules/.bin`. To generate documentation for the file
`yourJavaScriptFile.js`:

    ./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js

Or if you installed JSDoc globally, simply run the `jsdoc` command:

    jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js

By default, the generated documentation is saved in a directory named `out`. You
can use the `--destination` (`-d`) option to specify another directory.

Run `jsdoc --help` for a complete list of command-line options.

### Mozilla Rhino

All versions of JSDoc 3 run on a customized version of Mozilla Rhino, which
requires Java. You can run JSDoc 3 on Java 1.6 and later.

#### Installing JSDoc for Mozilla Rhino

To install JSDoc, download a .zip file for the
[latest development version](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/archive/master.zip)
or a [previous release](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/tags).

You can also use git to clone the
[JSDoc repository](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc):

    git clone https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc

The JSDoc repository includes a
[customized version of Mozilla Rhino](https://github.com/jsdoc3/rhino). Make
sure your Java classpath does not include any other versions of Rhino. (On OS X,
you may need to remove the file `~/Library/Java/Extensions/js.jar`.)

**Note**: In JSDoc 3.3.0 and later, if you need to run JSDoc on Mozilla Rhino,
do not install JSDoc with npm. Use one of the methods described above.

#### Running JSDoc with Mozilla Rhino

On OS X, Linux, and other POSIX systems, to generate documentation for the file
`yourJavaScriptFile.js`:

    ./jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js

Or on Windows:

    jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js

By default, the generated documentation is saved in a directory named `out`. You
can use the `--destination` (`-d`) option to specify another directory.

Run `jsdoc --help` for a complete list of command-line options.
