Installation and Usage
----------------------

You can run JSDoc on either Node.js or Mozilla Rhino.

### Node.js

Native support for Node.js is available in JSDoc 3.3.0 and later. JSDoc
supports Node.js 0.10 and later.

#### Installing JSDoc for Node.js

You can install JSDoc in your project's `node_modules` folder, or you can
install it globally.

To install the latest alpha version:

    npm install jsdoc@"<=3.3.0"

To install the latest development version:

    npm install git+https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc.git

#### Running JSDoc with Node.js

If you installed JSDoc locally, the JSDoc command-line tool is available in
`./node_modules/.bin`. To generate documentation for the file
`yourJavaScriptFile.js`:

    ./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js

Or if you installed JSDoc globally, simply run the `jsdoc` command:

    jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js

By default, the generated documentation is saved in a directory named `out`. You
can use the `--destination` (`-d`) option to specify another directory.

Run `jsdoc --help` for a complete list of command-line options.

### Mozilla Rhino

All versions of JSDoc 3 run on a customized version of Mozilla Rhino, which
requires Java. You can run JSDoc 3 on Java 1.6 and later.

#### Installing JSDoc for Mozilla Rhino

To install JSDoc, download a .zip file for the
[latest development version](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/archive/master.zip)
or a [previous release](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc/tags).

You can also use git to clone the
[JSDoc repository](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc):

    git clone git+https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc.git

The JSDoc repository includes a
[customized version of Mozilla Rhino](https://github.com/jsdoc3/rhino). Make
sure your Java classpath does not include any other versions of Rhino. (On OS X,
you may need to remove the file `~/Library/Java/Extensions/js.jar`.)

**Note**: In JSDoc 3.3.0 and later, if you need to run JSDoc on Mozilla Rhino,
do not install JSDoc with npm. Use one of the methods described above.

#### Running JSDoc with Mozilla Rhino

On OS X, Linux, and other POSIX systems, to generate documentation for the file
`yourJavaScriptFile.js`:

    ./jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js

Or on Windows:

    jsdoc yourJavaScriptFile.js

By default, the generated documentation is saved in a directory named `out`. You
can use the `--destination` (`-d`) option to specify another directory.

Run `jsdoc --help` for a complete list of command-line options.


Templates and Build Tools
-------------------------

The JSDoc community has created numerous templates and other tools to help you
generate and customize your documentation. Here are just a few:

### Templates

+ [jaguarjs-jsdoc](https://github.com/davidshimjs/jaguarjs-jsdoc)
  ([example](http://davidshimjs.github.io/jaguarjs/doc))
+ [DocStrap](https://github.com/terryweiss/docstrap)
+ [jsdoc3Template](https://github.com/DBCDK/jsdoc3Template)
  ([example](https://github.com/danyg/jsdoc3Template/wiki#wiki-screenshots))

### Build Tools

+ [JSDoc Grunt plugin](https://github.com/krampstudio/grunt-jsdoc)
+ [JSDoc ant task](https://github.com/jannon/jsdoc3-ant-task)

### Generating Typeface Fonts

JSDoc 3 uses the [OpenSans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) typeface, the fonts for which can be re-generated as follows:

1. Open the [OpenSans page at Font Squirrel](<http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans>).
2. Click on the 'Webfont Kit' tab.
3. Either leave the subset drop-down as 'Western Latin (Default)', or if we decide we need more glyphs than change it to 'No Subsetting'.
4. Click the 'DOWNLOAD @FONT-FACE KIT' button.
5. For each typeface variant we plan to use, copy the 'eot', 'svg' and 'woff' files into the 'templates/default/static/fonts' directory.
