<h1>Testing JSDoc 3</h1>

<h2>Running Tests</h2>

<p>Running tests is easy.  Just change your working directory to the jsdoc folder
and run the following command on Windows:</p>

<pre><code>jsdoc -T</code></pre>

<p>... or on a Max OSX or *nix platform:</p>

<pre><code>./jsdoc -T</code></pre>

<p>If you can't get the short-form commands to work, try invoking Java directly:</p>

<pre><code>java -cp lib/js.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.shell.Main -opt -1 \
-modules nodejs_modules -modules rhino_modules -modules . \
jsdoc.js -T</code></pre>

<h2>Writing Tests</h2>

<p>Adding tests is pretty easy, too.  You can write tests for jsdoc itself (to 
make sure tags and the parser, etc. are working properly), tests for plugins, and/or
tests for templates.</p>

<p>JSDoc 3 uses Jasmine (https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) as its testing framework.
Take a look at that project's wiki for documentation on writing tests in general.</p>

<h3>Tests for JSDoc</h3>

<p>Take a look at the files in the <code>test</code> directory for many examples of
writing tests for JSDoc itself.  the <code>test\fixtures</code> directory hold fixtures
for use in the tests and the <code>test\specs</code> directory holds the tests themselves.</p>

<h3>Tests for plugins</h3>

<p>Tests for plugins are found in <code>plugins\test</code> directory.   Plugins containing
tests that were installed with the Jakefile install task will be run automatically.</p>

<h3>Tests for templates</h3>
