<h3>Syntax</h3>

<code>@event &lt;className>#[event:]&lt;eventName></code>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
    The @event tag allows you to document an event that can be fired. A typical event is represented
    by an object with a defined set of properties.
</p>

<p>
    Once you have used the @event tag to define a specific type of event, you can use the @fires tag
    to indicate that a method can fire that event.
</p>

<p>
    JSDoc automatically prepends the namespace <code>event:</code> to each event's name. In general,
    you must include this namespace when you link to the event in another doclet. (The @fires tag is
    a notable exception; it allows you to omit the namespace.)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: JSDoc 3 uses @event doclets to document the content of an event. In
    contrast, JSDoc Toolkit 2 used @event doclets to identify a function that can be fired when an
    event of the same name occurs.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
    The following examples show how to document an event in the <code>Hurl</code> class called
    <code>snowball</code>. The event contains an object with a single property.
</p>

{{#example}}Documenting a function call as an event
/**
 * Throw a snowball.
 *
 * @fires Hurl#snowball
 */
Hurl.prototype.snowball = function() {
    /**
     * Snowball event.
     *
     * @event Hurl#snowball
     * @type {object}
     * @property {boolean} isPacked - Indicates whether the snowball is tightly packed.
     */
    this.emit('snowball', {
        isPacked: this._snowball.isPacked
    });
};
{{/example}}

{{#example}}Using a named doclet to document an event
/**
 * Throw a snowball.
 *
 * @fires Hurl#snowball
 */
Hurl.prototype.snowball = function() {
    // ...
};

/**
 * Snowball event.
 *
 * @event Hurl#snowball
 * @type {object}
 * @property {boolean} isPacked - Indicates whether the snowball is tightly packed.
 */
