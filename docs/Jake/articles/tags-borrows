<h3>Syntax</h3>

<code>@borrows &lt;that namepath&gt; as &lt;this namepath&gt;</code>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
    The @borrows tag allows you to add documentation for another symbol to your documentation.
</p>

<p>
    This tag would be useful if you had more than one way to reference a function, but you didn't want to duplicate the same documentation in two places.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>
    In this example there exists documentation for the "trstr" function, but "util.trim" is just a reference to that same function by a different name.
</p>

{{#example}}Duplicate the documentation for trstr as util.trim
/**
    @namespace
    @borrows trstr as trim
*/
var util = {
    trim: trstr
};

/** 
    Remove whitespace from around a string.
    @param {string} str
 */
function trstr(str) {
}
{{/example}}
