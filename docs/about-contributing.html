	<h1>How To Contribute</h1>


<h2>Pull Requests</h2>

<p>If you're thinking about making some changes, maybe fixing a bug, or adding a 
snazzy new feature, first, thank you.  Contributions are very welcome.  Things 
need to be manageable for the maintainers, however. So below you'll find  <strong>The 
fastest way to get your pull request merged in.</strong>  Some things, particularly how
you set up your branches and work with git, are just suggestions, but pretty good
ones.</p>

<ol><li><p><strong>Create a remote to track the base jsdoc3/jsdoc repository</strong>
This is just a convenience to make it easier to update your <code>&lt;tracking branch&gt;</code>
(more on that shortly).  You would execute something like:</p><pre><code>git remote add base git://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc.git</code></pre><p>Here 'base' is the name of the remote.  Feel free to use whatever you want. </p></li><li><p><strong>Set up a tracking branch for the base repository</strong>
We're gonna call this your <code>&lt;tracking branch&gt;</code>.  You will only ever update
this branch by pulling from the 'base' remote. (as opposed to 'origin')</p><pre><code>git branch --track pullpost base/master
git checkout pullpost</code></pre><p>Here 'pullpost' is the name of the branch.  Fell free to use whatever you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Create your change branch</strong>
Once you are in <code>&lt;tracking branch&gt;</code>, make sure it's up to date, then create
a branch for your changes off of that one.</p><pre><code>git branch fix-for-issue-395
git checkout fix-for-issue-395</code></pre><p>Here 'fix-for-issue-395' is the name of the branch.  Feel free to use whatever
you want.  We'll call this the <code>&lt;change branch&gt;</code>.  This is the branch that
you will eventually issue your pull request from.</p><p>The purpose of these first three steps is to make sure that your merge request
has a nice clean diff that only involves the changes related to your fix/feature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make your changes</strong>
On your <code>&lt;change branch&gt;</code> make any changes relevant to your fix/feature.  Don't
group fixes for multiple unrelated issues or multiple unrelated features together.
Create a separate branch for each unrelated changeset.  For instance, if you're
fixing a bug in the parser and adding some new UI to the default template, those
should be separate branches and merge requests.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add tests</strong>
Add tests for your change.  If you are submitting a bugfix, include a test that
verifies the existence of the bug along with your fix.  If you are submitting
a new feature, include tests that verify proper feature function, if applicable.
See the readme in the 'test' directory for more information</p></li><li><p><strong>Commit and publish</strong>
Commit your changes and publish your branch (or push it if it's already published)</p></li><li><p><strong>Issue your pull request</strong>
On github.com, switch to your <code>&lt;change branch&gt;</code> and click the 'Pull Request'
button.  Enter some meaningful information about the pull request.  If it's a bugfix,
that doesn't already have an issue associated with it, provide some info on what
situations that bug occurs in and a sense of it's severity.  If it does already have
an issue, make sure the include the hash and issue number (e.g. '#100') so github
links it.</p><p>If it's a feature, provide some context about the motivations behind the feature,
why it's important/useful/cool/necessary and what it does/how it works.  Don't 
worry about being too verbose. Folks will be much more amenable to reading through
your code if they know what its supposed to be about.</p></li></ol>
